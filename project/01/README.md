# Boolean Logic

## Chip implementations

A huge help for this which is not shown in the book is [creating logic gates from
truth tables using boolean algebra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnmDx0k)

The general gist of this is to find where the expressions are output to `1` and
use the sum of products (SOP) to figure out the gate. This may be relatively
complex at first, but it can be simplified after.

- [AND](./and.hdl)
- [OR](./or.hdl)
- [NOT](./not.hdl)
- [XOR](./xor.hdl)
